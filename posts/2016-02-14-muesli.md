TL;DR
---
The state of the Haskell ecosystem with respect to databases has been
characterized as [immature][gabriel].
Efforts have been made towards improving the bindings for various foreign systems,
ensuring SQL query safety through static checking, and faking row polymorphism.
An alternative approach is to implement a database as an EDSL.
For example [acid-state][acid] offers ACID semantics on top of normal
serializable Haskell types.
[muesli][muesli] takes this further by adding automatic index management,
improving performance and removing much of the boilerplate.

The problem
---
1 page

- embedded apps require embedded database
- quotient design: transactions on top of standard serializable types
- acid-state poor performance (serializes queries, not data; all data in memory)
- TH boilerplate
- indexing

My idea
---
2 pages

- multi-version concurrency
- log file separate from data file
- use GHC.Generics instead of TH
- newtype & phantom types for data consistency
- add metadata for references and indexes
- indexes implemented with standard containers

### Persistence implemented

- acid-state
- CurryDB
- datalog
- DSH
- HaskRel
- HGraphStorage
- keyvaluehash
- perdure
- hs-cdb
- pure-cdb
- qudb
- RefSerialize
- TCache
- tx

Conclusions and further work
---

- performance good enough for small/medium apps
- implementation simple enough for beginners
- hackage downloads
- not ready for prime time
- double buffering design

### Immediate upgrades

- more indexes
- migration
- joins
- abstract query language + query optimization
- QuickCheck, benchmarks

### Hopes & dreams

- remote queries, replication, static closures?
