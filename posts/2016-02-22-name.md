### Welcome to the jungle!

This is my personal blog on functional programming and its application
to real-time simulation.
You may expect intermittent pieces on logic $\cap$ math $\cap$ physics,
and hopefully not too many rants.
But ultimately, I have no clue what the blog will end up raving about.
For all I know it could spawn enormous Juche pumas playing cylindrical Go along
Iapetus' equatorial ridge, sabotaging the moon's hydrostatic balance.
Worse, I couldn't snatch it a rigid designator, leading to a dangerous
pun compromise.
But let me apologize and elaborate.

[Functional fixity][fixity] is a term from cognitive science describing one's
inability to use an object in a novel way.
It's your memory entangling the representation of the object with that of its
intended function, typically after prolonged usage.

For instance, after learning to work a monad to a particular goal, a fledgling
Haskeller may feel inclined to blog about what monads are like, promptly
forgetting the structure and laws of the mathematical object, a lapse that has
little to do, I'll argue, with the suitability of figurative language
for presenting abstract concepts.

Brent Yorgey's [classic article][brent] tells the story of the failed monad
tutor who supplies just the root of his intuition and expects the entire tree
to magically string along into his reader's head, confusing, as it were,
the pattern used for naming common metaphors (**A is B**), with the metaphors
themselves, which are known to develop from elementary inter-domain mappings of
arbitrary complexity.
The article concludes with a fair advice: play with the abstract concept itself,
don't just get accustomed with more of its incarnations and business roles.

But throughout the story there is an undertone, or potential uncharitable
reading, of a rusty grammarian that 'splains: *"analogy is bad, m'kay?"*.
The Haskell community was quick to pick up on it, and confessed they actually
*take no pickle with [burrito] expositions*.
And I concur, even outright allegories are fly as long as the mapping
maintains a sense of [faithfulness][quotient] that allows crisscrossing
the domain boundaries without garbling the meaning, and the author doesn't
forget to mention all independent generators of the mapping.
I also think that people are pretty good at it, and the confusion Brent's
article poses is a bit of a straw man, as the real problem is not only deeper,
but it affects smart, educated people significantly more.
I'm talking about functional fixity, a case of *"the curse of knowledge"*,
two concepts I've recently been exposed to by Steven Pinker's wonderful book
["The Sense of Style"][pinker].

Knowledge is cursed by intelligence.
More of the later founds more opportunities for the curse to strike,
and intensifies the virulence inside each area.
Now imagine a cloud-hosted compiler so smart, that it understands your program is
socially or economically expandable, and all of it gets eliminated as dead code.
You'd have to fight it, politically.
Likewise, our extra keen memory will be better at compressing our experience of
the *path* we took to reach it, to a more lucrative, but potentially deceitful
arrangement.

But this doesn't mean our metaphor is somehow fundamentally mangled, rendered
useless for teaching, or worse, all metaphors are, and only some thoroughly
protestant "hard work" can make you understand anything.
On the contrary, the monad tutor is right in believing that *"if it works for
me, it could help others too"*.
It's all a question of first, checking that it actually works (both ways),
and second, having a consistent & complete rendition, which can be achieved,
against the odds brought about by the curse of knowledge, with analogy
remodeling and some, well, hard work.

When writing about something, notwithstanding your preference for the
**classic style** of exposition, where you speak as if you have something
to show and you're merely guiding the reader towards a *better vantage point*,
you are still essentially creating entirely new knowledge, and should only
consider what you already know as one among many aids.
But the classic style itself is exactly such and aid, and also a metaphor,
recommended for its efficiency in reducing the bloat caused by, to quote
Pinker, "metadiscourse, signposting, hedging, apologizing, professional
narcissism, clichés, mixed metaphors, metaconcepts, zombie nouns,
and unnecessary passives".

*Rather then wailing destitution, potatoes can be your salvation.*

As for myself, after 2 years packed with Haskell related papers, books, online
courses and other materials, I still cannot recognize a full frontal monad, eyes
scolding, for I've got into a habit of only thinking about them at practical
applications' express requisition.
So I wish to transfix this routine with gratuitous multi-modal strolls of
prolixity and higher-ranked functional references.
Or so this cortege of thought seems to betoken.
