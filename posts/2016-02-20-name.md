Welcome to the jungle!
----------------------

This is my personal blog on functional programming and its application
to real-time simulation.
You may expect intermittent pieces on logic $\cap$ math $\cap$ physics,
and hopefully not too many rants.

Ultimately, I have no clue what the blog will end up raving about.
For all I know it could spawn enormous Juche pumas playing cylindrical Go along
Iapetus' equatorial ridge, sabotaging the moon's hydrostatic balance.
Even worse, I couldn't find it a rigid designator, leading to a dangerous
pun-core compromise.
But let me apologize and elaborate.

[Functional fixity][fixity] is a term from cognitive science describing one's
inability to use an object in a novel way.
It's your memory entangling the representation of the object with its functions,
typically after prolonged praxis.

For instance, after learning to work a monad to a particular goal, a fledgling
Haskeller may feel inclined to write a story about what monads really are
like, promptly forgetting the structure and laws of the mathematical object.
A lapse that has little to do with the suitability of analogy or allegory
for presenting abstract concepts, as Brent Yorgey's [classic article][brent]
appears to suggest.
His narrative of the writer who supplies just the root and expects the entire
tree to magically string along into reader's head, his account for author's
mixup concerning the nature of this tree, and his advice to play more with the
abstract object itself beside covering more cases, are all fair & fly.

But here our continuations diverge.
Brent implies that monad tutors confuse the pattern used for naming common
metaphors (*A is B*), with the metaphors themselves, which can in fact develop
from domain mappings of arbitrary complexity.
However, as long as the interpretation maintains a sense of faithfulness that
allows sleekly crisscrossing boundaries without garbling meaning,
I take no pickle with [burrito] expositions.

Yet after 2 years packed with Haskell related papers, books, online courses
and other materials, I still cannot recognize a full frontal monad, eyes
scolding, for I've got into a habit of only thinking about monads at practical
applications' express requisition.
So I wish to transfix this routine with gratuitous multi-modal strolls of
prolixity and higher-ranked functional references.
Or so this cortege of thought seems to betoken.

The markdown and the beast
--------------------------

Overall I'm quite pleased with [Hakyll], the Haskell [Jakyll].

For convenient [GitHub Pages][github] hosting, you can either keep the sources
in the same repo with the output, in which case you'll need some convoluted
scripts to strap it together, or you can figure it's not worth the bother and
just manage a slightly more tedious [2][repo1] - [repo][repo2] setup, like me.
After committing changes in the source repo, I run `site deploy` and then
`git commit` and `git push` the front repo.
I even dig the extra control.

*Hakyll* comes integrated with the mighty, multilingual [pandoc], that
champions an enriched [Markdown] dialect I'm delighted to play with.
In particular, you can write paper-like articles, publish them straightforwardly
on your blog, and generate alongside a *pdf* with the `pandoc` executable,
all the while inlining *LaTeX* for math.

To render the formulas you can pick a standard *js* service like *MathJax* or,
with the [`WebTeX`][HTMLMathMethod] constructor, a remote image service like
*Google Chart API*, or you can generate math images directly on your server
with the [__latex-formulae-hakyll__][lfh] package, all painless to setup.
Currently, the blog employs the [`MathML`][HTMLMathMethod] variant to breed
*MathML* directly inside the *XHTML*.
Moreover, it injects an icon under the headline (but only if the *Markdown*
source file is explicitly tagged with `math` in the header section, like this
post's), to advise readers they should use a browser sporting native
*MathML*, like *Firefox* or *Safari*.

Here's a test formula for you:
$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\ e^{- 2\pi i x \xi}\,dx.$

Web theme
---------

I started with the default *Hakyll* theme but made a few adjustments.

All sizes, including fonts and page width, are relative (in `em` units).
There is also no `font-family` setting, so the site will use the default fonts
on all devices.
High-dpi displays won't collapse the text into a string of microscopic black
holes, while on wide screens the need for binoculars and current line
markers for navigation will be eschewed.

The black icons are vectorial (*SVG*), so they look smooth on high-dpi too.
With a *SVG* editor like [Inkscape] it's very quick to take some public domain
icon from the net (wikipedia has plenty) and delete layers, change colors and
sizes, or add your own shapes.
The hover effect just uses the *CSS3* `opacity` property.

I followed [Dan Piponi][dan]'s example and inlined the *archive* page into *home*
and *contact* into the footer.
I reckoned the text that would normally go there would be something
generic, and surely I'd write more compelling things in the actual blog.
So why would I pin the trivia?
Personal info belongs to social networking accounts these days.
And being more honest by placing the index inside `index.html` should benefit
search engine robots' situational awareness (humans' too!).

Hope this pasta is plain enough for a copy.
