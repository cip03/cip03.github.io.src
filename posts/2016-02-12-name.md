Welcome!

This is my personal blog on functional programming and its applications
to graphics, physics and distributive computing.
There may be occasional posts on logic + math, and hopefully not too many rants.

I couldn't find a rigid designator for it so I'm going with the lazy pun instead.

Hakyll
---
Overall I'm very happy with [Hakyll][hakyll]. I think this [2][repo1] -
[repo][repo2] setup is the easiest to work with on [GitHub Pages][github].
I stole some code from [Danny Gratzer's blog][jozefg] to get me started,
but I got going quickly.

CSS Theme
---
I started with the default `Hakyll` theme but made a few adjustments.

All sizes, including fonts and page width, are relative (in `em` units).
There is also no `font-family` setting, so the site will use the default fonts
on all devices.
Especially on high-dpi screens your eyes won't be strained by the microscopic
fixed text that so many sport, while on wide screens you won't need binoculars
and current line markers to navigate.

The black icons are vectorial (*SVG*), so they look good on high-dpi too.
With a *SVG* editor like [Inkscape][svg] it's very fast to take some free icon
from the net and delete layers, change colors and sizes, or make your own.
The hover effect just uses the *CSS3* `opacity` property.

Hope this pasta is simple enough for a copy.
