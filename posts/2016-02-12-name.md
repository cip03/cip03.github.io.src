Welcome!
--------

This is my personal blog on functional programming and its application
to real-time simulations.
There may be occasional posts on logic + math, and hopefully not too many rants.

I couldn't find a rigid designator for it so I'm going with the lazy pun instead.

Some other blogs that I like are [Bartosz Milewski's][bartosz] for its
comprehensive presentation of general topics,
[Dan Piponi's][dan] for its concrete inquiries into abstract concepts,
and [Danny Gratzer's][jozefg] for its meta stability while juggling.
I'd write stuff mostly to help me think when I'm stuck, as preached by
[Simon Peyton Jones][spj], hoping to boost my [public humiliation based][scott]
learning rate, or at least develop a new discipline for my fiat spaghetti brain.

The Hakyll / pandoc / LaTeX / MathML combo
---------------------------------

Overall I'm very happy with [Hakyll]. I think this [2][repo1] -
[repo][repo2] setup is the easiest to work with [GitHub Pages][github] hosting.
I stole some code from Danny's blog to get me started, but I got going quickly.

*Hakyll* comes integrated with the powerful, multilingual [pandoc], which allows
writing the posts in an enriched [Markdown] dialect.
For instance, you can write paper-like articles, post them on your blog, and
also generate a *pdf* with the `pandoc` executable, all the while inlining
*LaTeX* for math.

For rendering you can use a standard *js* service like *MathJax*, or a remote
image service like *Google Chart API* with the [`WebTeX`][HTMLMathMethod]
option, or you can generate math images directly on your server with the
[__latex-formulae-hakyll__][lfh] package, which is also easy to setup.
Currently, the blog uses the [`MathML`][HTMLMathMethod] option to generate
*MathML* directly, and inserts an icon under the title if the *md* file is
explicitly tagged with `math` in the header section, like this post, to notify
users they should use a proper browser like *Firefox* or *Safari*.

Here's a test formula for you:
$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\ e^{- 2\pi i x \xi}\,dx.$

Web theme
---------

I started with the default *Hakyll* theme but made a few adjustments.

All sizes, including fonts and page width, are relative (in `em` units).
There is also no `font-family` setting, so the site will use the default fonts
on all devices.
High-dpi screens won't turn the text into a series of microscopic black
holes, while on wide screens the need for binoculars and current line
markers for navigation will be eschewed.

The black icons are vectorial (*SVG*), so they look good on high-dpi too.
With a *SVG* editor like [Inkscape] it's very fast to take some free icon
from the net (wikipedia has plenty) and delete layers, change colors and sizes,
or add your own.
The hover effect just uses the *CSS3* `opacity` property.

I followed Dan's example and inlined the *archive* page into *home*
and *contact* into the footer.
The reasoning is this: the text that would normally go there would be something
generic, and I hope I'll write more interesting things in the actual blog.
So why would I pin that?
Personal info belongs to social networking accounts these days, and being more
honest by putting the index into `index.html` should assist search engines
robots' situational awareness (humans' too!).

Hope this pasta is simple enough for a copy.
