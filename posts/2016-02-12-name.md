Welcome!
---
This is my personal blog on functional programming and its applications
to graphics, physics and distributive computing.
There may be occasional posts on logic + math, and hopefully not too many rants.

I couldn't find a rigid designator for it so I'm going with the lazy pun instead.

Beside the usual journal content (project updates, etc.) I plan to write
"review" articles as grounded and complete as [Bartosz Milewski's][bartosz],
with thoughtful examples as powerful as [Dan Piponi's][dan], while keeping
myself on the move as swiftly as [Danny Gratzer's][jozefg] juggling.
And I only publish this preposterous claim now in order to boost my
[public humiliation learning][scott].
Well, not really learning, as without the public notability there will be
little outside interference, but even as a motivator it'll do. I hope.

Hakyll control

Overall I'm very happy with [Hakyll][hakyll]. I think this [2][repo1] -
[repo][repo2] setup is the easiest to work with [GitHub Pages][github] hosting.
I stole some code from Danny's blog to get me started, but I got going quickly.

Web theme
---
I started with the default `Hakyll` theme but made a few adjustments.

All sizes, including fonts and page width, are relative (in `em` units).
There is also no `font-family` setting, so the site will use the default fonts
on all devices.
Especially on high-dpi screens your eyes won't be strained by the microscopic
fixed text that so many sport, while on wide screens you won't need binoculars
and current line markers to navigate.

The black icons are vectorial (*SVG*), so they look good on high-dpi too.
With a *SVG* editor like [Inkscape][svg] it's very fast to take some free icon
from the net and delete layers, change colors and sizes, or make your own.
The hover effect just uses the *CSS3* `opacity` property.

I followed Dan's example and inlined the *archive* page into *home*
and *contact* into the footer.
The reasoning is this: the text that would normally go there would be something
generic, and I hope I'll write more interesting things in the actual blog.
So why would I pin the shittiest posts?
Personal info belongs to social networking accounts.
Plus, I think it helps with search engines robots' situational awareness
(humans too!) by being more honest.
The home page is the index. That's why it's called "index.html".

Hope this pasta is simple enough for a copy.
