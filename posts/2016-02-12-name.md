Welcome!
--------

This is my personal blog on functional programming and its applications
to real-time graphics, physics and distributive computing.
There may be occasional posts on logic + math, and hopefully not too many rants.

I couldn't find a rigid designator for it so I'm going with the lazy pun instead.

Beside the usual journal content (project updates, etc.) I'll write
review articles as grounded and complete as [Bartosz Milewski's][bartosz],
with thoughtful examples as powerful as [Dan Piponi's][dan], while keeping
myself on the move as swiftly as [Danny Gratzer's][jozefg] juggling,
with the purposefulness preached by [Simon Peyton Jones][spj] for fuel.
And I only publish this preposterous claim now in order to boost my
[public humiliation based][scott] learning rate.
Well, not really learning, as with the public notability of a punk like me
there will be little outside interference, but even as a motivator it'll do.
I hope.

The Hakyll / pandoc / LaTeX combo
---------------------------------

Overall I'm very happy with [Hakyll]. I think this [2][repo1] -
[repo][repo2] setup is the easiest to work with [GitHub Pages][github] hosting.
I stole some code from Danny's blog to get me started, but I got going quickly.

*Hakyll* comes integrated with the powerful, multilingual [pandoc], which allows
writing the posts in an enriched [Markdown] dialect I enjoy greatly.
For instance, you can write paper-like articles, post them on your blog, and
also generate a *pdf* or even $\LaTeX$ with the `pandoc` executable, all the
while inlining $\LaTeX$ for math.

To configure it you can use a standard *js* service like *MathJax*, or a remote
image service like *Google Chart API* with the [`WebTeX`][HTMLMathMethod]
option, or you can generate math images directly on your server with the
[__latex-formulae-hakyll__][lfh] package, which is also easy to setup.
I currently use *MathJax*, but only include the script if the *md* file is
explicitly tagged with `math` in the header section.

It can't do the modern thing though, which is rendering *MathML* inline as
*SVG*, with no need for *js* or images.
For instance if you go to the preferences panel in [wikipedia], down low
there is a *Math* section where you can activate the *MathML with SVG or PNG
fallback* option, to see what it looks like in your browser.
This method could be easily integrated in *Hakyll* with the same
[`pandocCompilerWithTransformM`][pandocHook] hook that
__latex-formulae-hakyll__ also uses.
I should investigate this further, as I plan to use *SVG* for diagrams too.

Web theme
---------

I started with the default *Hakyll* theme but made a few adjustments.

All sizes, including fonts and page width, are relative (in `em` units).
There is also no `font-family` setting, so the site will use the default fonts
on all devices.
Especially on high-dpi screens your eyes won't be strained by the microscopic
fixed text that so many sport, while on wide screens you won't need binoculars
and current line markers to navigate.

The black icons are vectorial (*SVG*), so they look good on high-dpi too.
With a *SVG* editor like [Inkscape] it's very fast to take some free icon
from the net and delete layers, change colors and sizes, or make your own.
The hover effect just uses the *CSS3* `opacity` property.

I followed Dan's example and inlined the *archive* page into *home*
and *contact* into the footer.
The reasoning is this: the text that would normally go there would be something
generic, and I hope I'll write more interesting things in the actual blog.
So why would I pin the shittiest posts?
Personal info belongs to social networking accounts.
Plus, I think it helps with search engines robots' situational awareness
(humans too!) by being more honest.

In short, *index.html* is the index. Groundbreaking, I know.

Hope this pasta is simple enough for a copy.
