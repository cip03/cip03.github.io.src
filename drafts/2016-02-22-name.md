title: Pun hazard, watch it!

Welcome to the jungle!

This is my personal blog on functional programming and its application
to real-time simulation.
You may expect intermittent pieces on logic $\cap$ math $\cap$ physics,
and hopefully not too many rants.
But ultimately, I have no clue what the blog will end up raving about.
For all I know it could spawn enormous Juche pumas playing cylindrical Go along
Iapetus' equatorial ridge, sabotaging the moon's hydrostatic balance.

Worse, I couldn't seize it a rigid designator, leading to a dangerous
pun compromise.
But allow me to waste your time by first elaborating incoherently and then,
apologizing unconvincingly.

[Functional fixity][fixity] is a term from cognitive science describing one's
inability to use an object in a novel way.
It's your memory entangling the representation of the object with that of its
intended function, typically after prolonged usage.

For instance, after learning to work a monad to a particular goal, a fledgling
Haskeller may feel inclined to blog about what monads are like, promptly
forgetting the structure and laws of the mathematical object, a lapse that has
little to do, I'll argue, with the suitability of figurative language
for presenting abstract concepts.

Brent Yorgey's [classic article][brent] tells the story of the failed monad
tutor who supplies just the root of his intuition and expects the entire tree
to magically string along into his reader's head, confusing, as it were,
the simple pattern used for naming common metaphors (**A is B**), with the
metaphors themselves, which are relations that develop from basic inter-domain
mappings of arbitrary size.
The article suggests that humans don't learn abstract concepts directly,
but gradually get accustomed with more of their incarnations and business roles,
to the point of epiphany.

But throughout the story there is an undertone, or potential uncharitable
reading, of a rusty grammarian that 'splains: *"analogy is bad, m'kay?"*.
The Haskell community was quick to pick up on it, and confessed they actually
*take no pickle with [burrito] expositions*.
And I concur, even outright allegories are fly as long as the mapping
maintains a sense of [faithfulness][piponi] that allows crisscrossing
the domain boundaries without garbling the meaning, and the author doesn't
forget to mention all of its independent generators.

I also think that people are pretty good at it^[This statement introduces the
central incoherency, as the main point is about hazards and such, but this was
the last opportunity to lead into my functional fixity stuff. Without it, the
non sequitur would have been all too obvious.], and the confusion Brent's
article poses is a bit of a straw man, as the real problem is not only deeper,
but it affects smart, educated people significantly more.
I'm talking about functional fixity, a case of *"the curse of knowledge"*,
two concepts I've recently been exposed to by Steven Pinker's wonderful book
["The Sense of Style"][pinker].

Knowledge is cursed by intelligence, the book goes^[Not really. I start by
paraphrasing, but quickly devolve into unsupported interpretations.].
More intelligence founds more opportunities for the curse to strike,
and intensifies the virulence inside each area.
Imagine a cloud-hosted compiler so smart, that it understands your program is
socially or economically expandable, and all of it gets eliminated as dead code.
You'd have to fight it, politically.
Likewise, our extra keen memory will be better at compressing our experience of
the *path* we took to reach it, to a more lucrative, but potentially deceitful
arrangement.

But this doesn't mean our metaphor is somehow fundamentally mangled, rendered
useless for teaching, or worse, all metaphors are, and only some thoroughly
puritan hard work can make you comprehend a heavenly subject.
On the contrary, the monad tutor is orthodox in believing that
*"if it works for me, it could help others too"*.
It's all a question of making sure it actually works, and having a consistent
& complete rendition, which can be achieved, against the odds brought about by
the curse of knowledge, with analogy remodeling and some, well, hard work.

When writing about something, notwithstanding your preference for the
**classic style** of exposition, where you speak as if you have something
to show and you're merely guiding the reader towards a *better vantage point*,
you are still essentially creating entirely new knowledge, and should only
consider what you already know as one among many aids.
But the classic style itself is exactly such an aid, specifically a metaphor,
recommended for its efficiency in reducing the bloat caused by, to quote
Pinker, *"metadiscourse, signposting, hedging, apologizing, professional
narcissism, clichés, mixed metaphors, metaconcepts, zombie nouns, and
unnecessary passives"*.

Rather then wailing destitution, potatoes can elate your salvation.^[This whack
of poetry was originally some place above, but every paragraph passed it on in
aversion, all the way to the back of the section where, amusingly, it met
Pinker's lament about mixed metaphors.]

Now look at what happened during the previous section.
In a narcissistic bid to justify the pun in the name of the website, I've
expanded and duct-taped an argument resting on a misinterpretation of Brent's
article.
This reveals the fundamental moral hazard that figurative language imparts.
If you want to be the funny guy but mess up your punch lines, it's just your
audience that would have payed up the price.
Eventually though, you'll end up with negative credit.

The safe bet is to use a single, well known, overarching allegory, like the
one at the core of the classic style, aka *the hitchhiker's guide*.
If you also yearn for local boosts, make sure they are connected in a tree of
relatedness, and enforce a cost restriction for each fork.
The payload you provide must be worth the context switch your reader will have
to carry out when changing branch; it needs not be atomic though, just an admix
of staggered reimbursements, like with [Okasaki's][okasaki] *banker's method*.

I leave this cortege of thought in its current insolvent state, as a testament
for future me: [*Watch it!*][malone]
