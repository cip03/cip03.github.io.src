Abstract
--------

The state of the Haskell ecosystem with respect to databases has been
characterized as [immature][gabriel].
Efforts have been made towards improving the bindings for various foreign
systems, ensuring SQL query safety through static checking, and faking row
polymorphism.
An alternative approach is to implement a database as an EDSL.
For example [acid-state][acid] offers ACID semantics on top of normal
serializable Haskell types.
[muesli][muesli] takes this further by adding automatic index management,
improving performance and removing much of the boilerplate, as needed in
embedded environments.

Introduction
------------
1 page

- embedded apps require embedded database (implicit schema + no marshaling boilerplate + static safety only)
- quotient design: transactions on top of standard serializable types
- "language/runtime extension" design requires feature minimalism/power (purity)

The problem
-----------
1 page

- acid-state poor performance (serializes queries, not data; all data in memory)
- TH boilerplate & marshaling code (eg: persistent)
- indexing, efficient navigation

My idea
-------
2 pages

- multi-version concurrency
- log file separate from data file
- use GHC.Generics instead of TH
- newtype & phantom types for data consistency
- add metadata for references and indexes
- indexes implemented with standard containers

The details
-----------
5 pages

Related work
------------
1-2 pages

### Boilerplate

- persistent / esqueleto
- safecopy

### ???

- vcache

### Persistence implemented

- acid-state
- CurryDB
- datalog
- DSH
- HaskRel
- HGraphStorage
- keyvaluehash
- perdure
- hs-cdb
- pure-cdb
- qudb
- RefSerialize
- TCache
- tx

Conclusions and further work
----------------------------

- performance good enough for small/medium apps
- implementation simple enough for beginners
- hackage downloads
- not ready for prime time
- double buffering design

### Immediate upgrades

- migration
- type safe field names & checking field types in queries
- cascade index for filtering on multiple fields
- more indexes
- joins
- abstract query language + query optimization
- QuickCheck, benchmarks

### Hopes & dreams

- remote queries, replication, static closures?
